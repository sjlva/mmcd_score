### When to use?

- At admission in the emergency department, to stratify the in-hospital mortality risk of patients with COVID-19.

### How was it developed and validated?

- Based in a cohort of 5,032 patients from 36 hospitals, from 17 cities in Brazil, as well as a cohort of 474 Spanish patients, following strict methodological criteria.

### Why to use?
 - It is easily calculated at bedside at admission.
 - It identifies four categories at increasing risk of death with a high level of accuracy, which outperformed other existing scores.
 - It may help healthcare practitioners to better identify patients with higher risk of mortality, to inform early interventions and the need of repetitive assessments to reduce the risk of death.

### How it should be used?

Only inhospital patients, through the use of variables easily accessible at admission.

### How it should not be used?
- It should not be considered a medical device.
- It must not be interpreted as patients from low risk group may be discharged for home treatment.
- It was validated in a cohort of Brazilian patients, and it should not be adopted for routine clinical use in other settings until it has been appropriately externally validated in those settings.
