## When to use?

 + At admission in the hospital, to stratify the in-hospital KRT needed risk of COVID-19 patients.

## How was it developed and validated?

 + Based in a cohort of 5,212 patients from 35 hospitals, from 17 cities in Brazil,following strict methodological criteria.

## Why to use?

+ It is easily calculated at bedside at admission.
+ It identifies three categories at increasing risk of KRT requirement with a high level of accuracy.
+ It may help healthcare practitioners to better identify patients with higher risk of KRT requirement and it may help to organize resource allocation to patients who are at the highest risk of KRT requirement.

## How it should be used?

+ Only in-hospital patients, through the use of variables easily accessible at admission.

## How it should not be used?

 + It should not be considered a medical device.
 + It should not be used with pregnant or pediatric patients.
 + It was validated in a cohort of Brazilian patients, and it should not be adopted for routine clinical use in other settings until it has been appropriately externally validated in those settings.
